# Frequently Asked Questions
Zenon Community FAQ
Intro
What is Zenon NoM?
Zenon Network of Momentum (NoM) presents an ambitious and fundamentally disruptive protocol with the following key features:
True decentralisation achieved through fair launch, anonymous devs, and by decoupling coinbase incentives from governance
Disinflationary reward mechanisms and non-custodial yield for all network participants
Hybrid PoW & PoS that complements, not competes with, Bitcoin
Focus on trust-less interoperability that brings value to other networks
Dual Ledger mechanism of block-lattice confirmed by meta-ledger for decoupled scalability
Dual Coin economy powered by two native currencies: ZNN and QSR
Feeless transaction paradigm shift powered by Plasma, generated through QSR acting as tokenized network throughput
Tokenization through protocol level native ZTS (Zenon Token Standard)
DAO of DAOs with on-chain voting for community-driven governance and Accelerator-Z venture funding
Which are the core use cases of Zenon Network?
Scaling through sidechains that allow for organic nested structures which align to real world spending and governance patterns.
How does Zenon achieve feeless transactions and smart contracts?
Plasma is used as tokenized transaction throughput or network gas (which doesn’t require to be spent) and can be generated either by locking (fusing) QSR or by generating PoW. There is a hard limit for Plasma via PoW.
Any fused QSR to create Plasma can be unfused again. If a user does not have any QSR, his/her machine will do a PoW computation to create Plasma “for free”. The only cost Plasma generates is the opportunity cost of holding and fusing QSR, or marginal hardware wear from PoW computations.
As a result, Plasma locks up resources (in terms of QSR or computation power) and thus successfully prevents network spam because no transaction can be conducted without it.
QSR holders can also fuse plasma for others and potentially loan or gift Plasma (gas) to those who need it.
What happens to a transaction after it is sent to the network?
Tx -> full nodes -> Pillars processing txs -> consensus -> appended to the block-lattice.

What is the vision of Zenon?
Zenon Network is working to solve some of the most fundamental issues facing decentralised networks. Unlike corporate web3, it achieves true decentralisation through its fair launch and by decoupling coinbase incentives from governance. It also eliminates transaction fees by tokenizing network bandwidth which is rewarded to those who help secure the network. Zenon is a hybrid PoW and PoS network, and aims at helping solve Bitcoin scaling by leveraging taproot as well as acting as a standalone L1 that uses Bitcoin’s PoW as root consensus. Rather than competing with Bitcoin as the hardest most secure currency, Zenon seeks to complement and add value to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
How does Zenon achieve Progressive Decentralisation?
Since day one, Zenon has followed a core principle: Progressive Decentralisation. This is reflected in every aspect of the project, for instance
Zenon is entirely community-driven without central leadership figures.
Protocol updates have to be approved by the community via a ZIP (Zenon Improvement Proposal)
The initial distribution was fully egalitarian with the same conditions for everyone.
Core team members are pseudonymous and their funding source remains a mystery.
Accelerator-Z is a fully community governed, decentralised on-chain funding program.
Zenon Network strictly follows the original Bitcoin ethos in every possible way.
Launch Event
How was ZNN distributed and the initial validator set created?
To create a sufficiently decentralised initial validator set for the legacy/placeholder network, the core team announced a public distribution event on Bitcointalk in May 2019.
There were no pre-sale or VC rounds, no insider or team allocations. The same terms applied for everyone, including the team.
80% of the emitted ZNN supply was algorithmically minted upon sending BTC to a specific address. 
Anyone who sent increments of 1 BTC was subject to a bonding process which locked up the Bitcoin in exchange for 5000 ZNN / BTC to run a validator node. 
Bonded BTC would then be paid back in monthly instalments over 1.5 years as long as the investor kept the validator node running via the legacy wallet. The whole process was fully automated through an algorithm called xStakes.
Anyone who contributed less than 1 BTC was not eligible for xStakes. 
The 1.5% premined supply (72403 ZNN) to bootstrap the network was fully distributed to community nodes / the initial validators.
20% of the emitted ZNN supply (roughly 800k ZNN) was allocated to the Zenon Fabric fund. Those coins are locked and do not generate rewards.They are now used as community grants for Accelerator Z.
What made the initial distribution uniquely libertarian? 
Zenon emulates the pure libertarian core principles and cypherpunk mindset found nowhere else but in the early Bitcoin community. 

It was therefore crucial for the initial distribution of ZNN to take place on a level playing field for everyone: 

It was publicly announced prior to being launched.
It allowed anyone to participate anonymously.
It submitted everyone to the same conditions.
No insider advantages were given to anyone.
All committed validators received a full refund.
No limitations existed as to how much any participant could acquire.
Why was an egalitarian initial distribution necessary? 
The initial validator set has a significant influence on a public ledger’s future degree of decentralisation. After all, it can only be as trustless as the degree of decentralisation of its validators. 

Therefore, it was critical for Zenon’s initial validator set to be formed as organically as possible with the only boundaries being set by the free market.
Why is Zenon’s initial validator set sufficiently decentralised?
The following criteria were cumulatively met:

The creation of the initial validator set was not skewed by unfair advantages.
The initial validator set could not coordinate to collude the system and break network security through double spends or chain splits.
The degree of decentralisation of the initial validator set was determined by nothing but the free market.
The underlying governance and financial incentives work towards progressive decentralisation after the initial validator set was created.
How does Zenon’s distribution event compare to others?
Unlike Zenon’s 100% public distribution, almost all crypto projects irreversibly undermine any real chance of decentralisation through often heavily inequitable conditions for insiders:

Multiple private funding rounds at discounted prices before offering the token for sale to the public.
Founder, VC and other insider allocations at heavy discounts or even for free.
Company or Foundation Reserves that are not subject to treasury management by community consensus but by the arbitrariness of the founding team.
Initial distribution events are used to raise (non-refundable) capital for insiders rather than to bootstrap the network in a sustainable way.

All too often founding teams confuse the creation of a public ledger with a seed stage private equity startup company and corrupt its potential of decentralisation at the very beginning to secure funding.
Why is Zenon’s egalitarian launch unique?
Because it requires an altruistic core team who puts in the preliminary work to build the protocol until the community can build on top of it.

This can take years of work which must not be funded by giving away stakes in the network to financiers at preferential conditions. This is where 99% of all other projects already fail. The only way for early participants to capitalise on progressively decentralised networks such as Bitcoin or Zenon is by driving adoption through sustainable value creation.

Thanks to an undisclosed funding source, the core development team of Zenon was able to create an immaculate network inception that can only be matched by Bitcoin’s. 
Can the xStake transactions be seen on-chain?
While the network has transitioned from the PIVX fork to Zenon NoM, it should still be possible to trace down all transactions and UTXO outputs of the distribution event on the legacy network by looking at its on-chain history.

However, every participant of the distribution event received a unique BTC address to send their Bitcoin to. For the sake of their privacy, the team chose not to publicise the contributors’ BTC addresses and left it up to the participants to disclose their transactions.
If the initial distro was anonymous, how do we know there was no foul play that could have centralised the initial validator set?
Critics question 
whether Zenon’s initial distribution was actually egalitarian 
whether the core team indeed subjected itself to the same terms as everyone else

What the criticism is based on
The fact that it is technically impossible to generate indisputable, on-chain proof since everyone participated in the initial distribution anonymously. 
Even if the core team disclosed every participant’s BTC address, there would be no way to verify whom they belonged to.

Their conclusion is
that one has no choice but to trust that the initial distribution was as fair as reported by the team and its participants due to the lack of irrefutable public proof. 
it is possible that the initial validator set was controlled by insiders and, therefore, more centralised than the public believes.

The logical fallacy this criticism is based on
Argumentum ad ignorantiam (argument from ignorance) which asserts that a proposition is false because it has not been proven true. 

What critics fail to consider
There is zero indication or proof that the initial distribution did not occur as reported
Strong circumstantial evidence suggests the claims around the fair launch are true 

Logically dissecting the possibilities and plausibilities for different foul play hypotheses makes this rather obvious:
Fair Play Hypothesis #1: Why it is improbable that the team just took ZNN from the initial distribution event to enrich itself:

All ZNN that was created during the initial distribution was minted in exchange for the BTC committed by the launch participants. The only pre-mine that happened was used to bootstrap the network and it was distributed across the initial validators.
The team could have just claimed an allocation if they wanted to get some ZNN “for free” as it’s standard practice for founding teams to get an insider allocation. Yet, they did not.
Most ZNN were given away for free in exchange for locking up some BTC and running nodes on a VPS for some time. The team would have gotten back their principal either way.
During all the time the core team was working on developing the Zenon NoM, ZNN was listed on unpopular exchanges with paper thin liquidity. The team never showed any interest in price discussions or listings on more popular exchanges, let alone creating unsubstantiated hype to attract buyers. In fact, the team’s communication was always characterised by a sole focus on technical development and the principle of “acta non verba”.
Fair Play Hypothesis #2: Why it is implausible that xStakes BTC refunds to initial distribution participants did not actually happen:

No community member ever complained about not receiving their xStakes refund.
Since the launch event was publicly announced, it is extremely unlikely that EVERY participant was “in on it” to pretend that xStakes took place.
Fair Play Hypothesis #3: Why it is implausible that the initial validator set consists of insiders who centralised the network from the start:

the launch was published on a public forum and anyone was able to participate;
there has been no case of a double spend, nor any proof of on-chain collusion by validators;
When and how was QSR introduced?
The secondary currency of Zenon NoM called Quasar (QSR) was introduced through a lock drop event prior to the launch of Alphanet. 

ZNN holders who ran a pillar or node on the legacy network automatically participated in the lock drop event and received up to 10 QSR for every ZNN they were holding. 

The lock drop event was based on multiple network snapshots spread across several weeks. Participating in each snapshot made ZNN holders eligible for the full amount of 10 QSR per ZNN.

ZNN holders who did not run validator infrastructure were able to participate by sending ZNN to an address specified by the team. While the ZNN was locked up in that address, their holders did not earn any staking rewards. By the end of the lock drop snapshot period, Zenon holders had entrusted the team with around 700k ZNN to participate in the QSR eligibility event.

The QSR was effectively introduced with the swap to Alphanet in November 2021.
Bitcoin Interoperability
What is known about Zenon’s relation to Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade?
Zenon’s Bitcoin interoperability design started months, if not years, in anticipation of the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade lock-in.
Zenon’s alphanet went live with the activation of taproot (and an alphanet “go-live countdown” led up to the Bitcoin taproot activation block for months in advance).
The go-zenon SDK supports bech32 addresses (Taproot format)
The mentioning of the taproot upgrade by Zenon’s official twitter account including the animation with sentinels locking BTC.
The core team spent 0.01 BTC (donated by the community) to burn “ZENON NETWORK” into the taproot activation block
How can Zenon help with Bitcoin scaling?
For everyday usage of BTC as money, scaling solutions are needed. In the future, most people will probably not use Bitcoin at the base layer for most monetary transactions. Zenon can provide first-class support for layered scaling solutions that Bitcoin cannot.
Current options are:
Lightning, which is great for specific purposes but not as a general scaling solution.
Locking BTC up in a centralised consortium multisig sidechain like Liquid.
Locking up BTC in a VC controlled (and thus centralised) L1.
Zenon’s egalitarian launch and progressive decentralisation mechanisms ensure that native or wrapped BTC will be the most decentralised and secure scaling solution for Bitcoin in existence.
Why does Zenon complement Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the hardest known currency whose scarcity is fundamentally tied to the laws of physics. It emits slow deflationary gains shared by all as humans improve technology for extracting and using energy. It may become the foundation of civilised money and value exchange.
Bitcoin as digital gold is currently following the path that gold did. Deemed too cumbersome for everyday use, it was  stored in private vaults of goldsmiths who then became fractional reserve bankers issuing paper gold notes. This became the foundation of the gold standard before the current sovereign debt standard was introduced.
As a truly decentralised, feeless layer 1, Zenon’s purpose is to become the shared trustless vault and issuer of paper notes of a global digital economy. Zenon can provide a much better foundation on top of the digital gold that is Bitcoin than the incumbent system ever could.
Therefore, Zenon is designed to be much more embedded into the actual economy and everyday usage, powering any use cases that require a feeless, permissionless, and trustless layer.
What can Zenon - Bitcoin interoperability look like?
Thanks to Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, there are various ways how Bitcoin interoperability with Zenon can look like:
1)     Trustless zBTC zts tokens where pillars participate in a threshold multisig (TSS) to manage a native BTC reserve as an underlying.
2)     Atomic swaps via HTLC (hash time locked contracts) and PTLC (point time locked contracts).
3)     Using PoW links to merge mine Bitcoin; the other way around is to merge mine ZNN and create Plasma for Bitcoin feeless transactions.
How can Zenon act as a trustless Bitcoin sidechain?
In a decentralised digital economy, Bitcoin acts as the trustless, globally accepted base layer.
But people spend most of their money within a certain context. In the physical world that could be a geographical region like a country. In the online world, within certain online communities.
A key premise for the acceptance of decentralised money is that users in one country don’t care about the other countries as long as the total amount of money they all use isn’t being arbitrarily changed.
Now imagine you can have side chains specific to each country, which keep the transactions off of the base layer to not bloat it. However, there will be times when people need to send money to people on other side chains. Like if someone visits another country.
That money needs to flow out of one sidechain, through the base layer, into the other sidechain.
As a user, I only care about my transactions and spending power (which is derived from total money supply). I don’t want to store/validate all the day-to-day transactions for countries or online communities that I’ll never interact with.
If Zenon can make it easy to launch trustless sidechains, then that is something novel to crypto and could be the game changer for scaling Bitcoin as the base layer. Bitcoin doesn’t really have a way to have trustless 2-way side chains. Spacechains, for instance, can achieve it 1 way with merge mining.
How can Zenon act as a trustless root chain for permissioned networks?
In addition to scaling a trustless base layer such as Bitcoin, a public decentralised trustless root chain can also enable private or centralised chains to be built on a trustless foundation. This would strongly mitigate the effects of broken trust within permissioned networks as they use the underlying public, trustless consensus as the ultimate judicial instance.
Trustlessness is thus the ends while decentralisation is the means to achieve it.
Will people have to buy ZNN to use Zenon scaled Bitcoin?
One popular criticism among bitcoiners is that sidechains rely on their own token for security and that people need to buy that token to use it.
Because Zenon uses PoW to generate plasma feelessly instead of forcing users to pay miners with gas, Bitcoin can be transacted on the Zenon Network at zero fees without having to acquire ZNN or QSR.
ZNN will still have value because again it is a fair currency for non energy-derived markets. And it can add additional utility through tokenization and public smart contracts, which also will require additional Plasma due to their increased transaction complexity. And to generate more Plasma you need QSR and to mine QSR you need ZNN.
Zenon’s Dual-Ledger
How easily can Zenon NoM be copied?
Bitcoin is PoW. Its hash power and the path it took to get there is something that can’t be replicated. And there are network effects preventing forks from getting sufficient adoption as BCH or BSV have shown.
Zenon is a hybrid PoW/PoS. Its initial validator set and how it got there is something that can’t be replicated. And Zenon also has network effects.
Once the value of Zenon is obvious, if someone were to try to create another Zenon, you’d probably just have VC networks that people don’t have a reason to use.
What are the two components of Zenon’s dual-ledger architecture?
Meta-DAG used for the consensus layer, containing the transactions required by the virtual voting algorithm
Block-lattice data structure used to store data from transactions that are settled in the network, i.e. sending, receiving, and zApp related transactions. The block-lattice forms the settled transaction structure which is stored as independent individual user account chains.
What are the key benefits of the Zenon Network dual-ledger?
Combining DAG and block-lattice inherently creates a mass-scalable DLT.
One key benefit of a DAG is its superior scalability compared to traditional blockchains (without compromise on decentralisation and network security).
In a DAG, consensus is not achieved in a straight line with a 1-to-1 connection between blocks; they can be like a graph instead. 1 block can confirm 3 blocks, and those 3 can confirm 3 more, etc. This makes reaching consensus in a DAG exponentially faster and more scalable than with traditional blockchains which are linear in consensus, meaning that one block can confirm another block, then onto the next one.
In NoM only the most recent transactions (“epochs”) are considered in the DAG. This avoids the graph of becoming bloated. Older transactions already confirmed are written to the transaction ledger, the separate block-lattice ledger.
In itself, block-lattice is already massively scalable since every user has a separate account chain, like their own blockchain. Massive throughput, basically.
Why does Zenon use a hybrid consensus model (PoW + PoS)?
What is Plasma and how does it enable scalable, feeless transactions?

Network Governance
Who is behind Zenon?
Zenon Network is an Independent Entity and does not claim to be backed by any organisation.  The core developers are anonymous and frequent public channels as pseudonyms.  “Mr. Kaine” communicates on occasion with the Zenon Official Telegram group, but his identity is unknown. In 2019, Zenon claims to have “hired” four core developers, a community manager and a graphics designer.

Mining ZNN and QSR
How are protocol emissions structured?
Like every other layer 1, Zenon relies on inflationary coinbase incentives for network security.
Because we are feeless, I think this emission must exist in perpetuity.
There is no theoretical cap on supply. There is a technical cap based on number of bytes used for supply. I don’t think we’ll get close to it.
The community expects the rewards to be disinflationary and decrease over time.
Because of the competitive revenue share mechanisms, all network participants get a part of new emissions.
The dual coin emissions help ensure continued progressive decentralization.
And there are many deflationary sinks as well where tokens are locked up or burned.
